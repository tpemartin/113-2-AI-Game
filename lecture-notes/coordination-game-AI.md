# Class Title
**Finding the Focal Point: Coordination Games & AI Insight**

---

## Class Objectives
- Deepen understanding of coordination games, especially the role of **focal points** (Schelling points).  
- Learn how to use AI to analyze game outcomes and uncover coordination dynamics.  
- Practice using AI tools to compare multiple coordination games and extract general principles.  
- Encourage reflective thinking on strategic behavior in uncertain coordination settings.

## Class Agenda

| Time | Activity |
|------|---------|
| 00:00 – 00:10 | **Warm-Up & Recap**: Brief review of last week’s game, including Slido results and ChatGPT's analysis. |
| 00:10 – 00:30 | **Lecture**: Introduction to focal points in coordination games (e.g., Schelling’s examples), with simple illustrative games. |
| 00:30 – 00:50 | **In-Class Game #1**: Play a new coordination game using Slido. Example: “You and a stranger are asked to meet in NYC without communication. Where do you go?” |
| 00:50 – 01:10 | **AI Analysis Demo**: Show how to submit Slido responses to ChatGPT with a well-designed prompt to identify patterns and focal points. |
| 01:10 – 01:30 | **In-Class Game #2**: Slido again – this time, a more abstract coordination game. Example: “Choose a number between 1 and 100. The person who chooses the number closest to the average wins.” |
| 01:30 – 01:45 | **AI Group Activity**: Students work in pairs or small groups to submit Slido results from Game #2 to ChatGPT and interpret its analysis. |
| 01:45 – 02:00 | **Class Discussion & Wrap-Up**: Share group insights, address follow-up questions, and summarize key takeaways. |

## Interactive Activities

1. **Slido-based coordination games**: Real-time, anonymous participation allows honest strategic choices.
2. **AI Analysis Exercise**: Use a prompt like:  
   *“Based on the following responses, what does this tell us about the coordination tendencies of the players? Are there any focal points?”*
3. **Small Group Reflection**: Let students come up with their own coordination games and test them using Slido + AI.

## Discussion Questions

- Why did certain responses become focal points in today’s games?
- How do context and framing affect what people think is the “natural” choice?
- In what way can AI help us identify coordination patterns we might miss ourselves?
- Would you play differently if the game was repeated with the same group?

---

## Key Takeaways

- Coordination games depend heavily on mutual expectations, not just payoffs.
- Focal points can emerge even in the absence of communication.
- AI can serve as an effective tool to uncover behavioral trends and rationales in collective decisions.
- Students can frame their own prompts to use AI critically—not just as answer machines but as co-analysts.

## Homework/Assignments

- **Assignment**: Choose a real-world example of a coordination game (e.g., traffic lights, tech platform adoption, social norms). Submit a short reflection (max 300 words) where you describe the game and simulate asking ChatGPT to analyze it (include your prompt and the response).
- **Reading**: Excerpt from *“The Strategy of Conflict” by Thomas Schelling* (intro + chapter on focal points).
- **Optional**: Create your own coordination game scenario and submit it via Google Form (may be used in the next class).
