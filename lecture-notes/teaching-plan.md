# 📚 AI + Game Theory — Week 2 Class Plan

## 🧠 Class Title  
**Stuck in Sync: Exploring Multiple Equilibria in Coordination Games with AI**

---

## 🎯 Class Objectives  
By the end of this class, students will be able to:

- Understand the concept of **multiple equilibria** in coordination games.
- Recognize how **expectations** influence strategic decision-making.
- Use **AI tools like ChatGPT** to analyze coordination outcomes and generate insights.
- Reflect on how small changes in framing or expectations can shift equilibrium outcomes.

## 🧩 Interactive Activities

### 🟢 Slido Coordination Game (25–45 min)

**Game prompt**:
> 今天我們是不同班級的學生，每班要決定畢業旅行去 A 或 B，只能去人數最多的那個地點才會成行，否則行程取消。請選擇地點。

- Responses collected via Slido  
- Results shared and analyzed in class

---

### 🤖 AI Exploration Breakouts (85–100 min)

In pairs or small groups:

- Students write a prompt like:
  > “Here are the coordination game outcomes. What might explain the shift in choices?”
- Submit to ChatGPT
- Compare and critique AI-generated reasoning

---

## 🗣️ Discussion Questions

- What makes one equilibrium more "focal" than another?
- Why did coordination improve (or worsen) in the second round?
- Can AI help us simulate expectation formation?
- What happens if players have **different beliefs** about what others will choose?

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Coordination games can have **multiple equilibria**.
- **Focal points** often drive convergence in strategies.
- AI tools like ChatGPT can help clarify strategic behavior.
- Minor changes in framing can **shift equilibrium outcomes**.

## 🏠 Homework / Assignments

### 📜 Reflection Prompt (Due next week)
> Write a 200-word reflection on how expectations influence coordination. Include one question you still have about coordination games.

### 🧠 AI Bonus Exercise (Optional)
- Input your reflection into ChatGPT and ask it to suggest improvements or additional insight.

### 📘 Reading Assignment
- *Game Theory for Applied Economists*, chapter on Coordination Games (specific pages to be assigned by Prof. C).
